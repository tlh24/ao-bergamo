-- Need a GUI, so we can adjust & check the centroid images. 
-- Need consistent numbering on the centroids.  Sometimes it misses some, which changes the meaning - ! 
-- Need to figure out how to convert pixel coordinates into waves or at least physical units. 
-- Some centroids are noisier than others; may have to weight individual centroids.

Have a gui -- repurposed from the sewing machine project -- seems to work well enough. 
Am thinking that we start with numbering and locations from the reference flat, which can be loaded at the start of the program. 
Need to read a matlab file via libmatio.. 

More importantly, will this wavefront sensor have sufficient precision to stabilize the deformable mirror?  
I guess if there are slow drifts over the whole aperture, probaby not --
to detect slight tip/tilt, on the order of many waves at the edges, you need to average over all the lenslets.  
To increase the sensitivity, we need to increase the focal length.
(Which of course decreases the dynamic range..)
The thorlabs WFS have a focal length of 4.1mm; we are using an array with a fl of 3.17mm.  So, they should be in the same ballpark..
